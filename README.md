# ErcNftMetadataAnalyzer

## Description

A repository housing a framework for generating and deploying ERC-721 NFTs with on-chain procedural metadata using a deterministic noise function seeded by the token ID, enabling verifiable uniqueness and eliminating reliance on external storage.

## Features

- Automatically detects and validates ERC-721 and ERC-1155 metadata schemas based on EIP specifications.
- Resolves and caches off-chain metadata URIs using IPFS, Arweave, and standard HTTP(S) protocols.
- Extracts and analyzes image features (e.g., dominant colors, object detection) from NFT media using computer vision algorithms.
- Calculates rarity scores based on attribute distributions within a specified NFT collection using statistical analysis.
- Generates a comprehensive report detailing potential security vulnerabilities related to metadata, such as malicious scripts or phishing links.
- Provides an API endpoint for querying metadata attributes and rarity scores with customizable filtering and sorting options.
- Integrates with decentralized storage solutions to preserve and verify the immutability of NFT metadata over time.
- Supports batch processing of multiple NFT contracts for efficient metadata analysis and reporting.
